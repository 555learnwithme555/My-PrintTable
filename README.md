My attempt of PrintTable

Multiple versions:
- Original - parts bought from printtable.com, VERY crappy design
- slid3r variant - my attempt (just for fun) to make 3D printer using fishing rope
- PrintTable 2 - real working
- hbot - attempt to achieve H-bot design so all the motors are off the gantry
- CoreXY - current version of my printer - working, new, more stable Z axis and better fan holder for print carriage
- backToBasics - attempt for new Z axis and new mechanics, did not work as expected, abbandoned
